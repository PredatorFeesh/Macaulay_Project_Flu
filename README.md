The site for this course can be accessed [here](https://eportfolios.macaulay.cuny.edu/siodmak19/) if you are a student from the class.  <br>
My reports can be seen [here](https://eportfolios.macaulay.cuny.edu/futureofnyc19/category/students/jason-azayev/), as this is a public facing website. Details will be worked
