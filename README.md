The site for this course can be accessed [here](https://eportfolios.macaulay.cuny.edu/siodmak19/) if you are a student from the class.  <br>
My reports can be seen [here](https://eportfolios.macaulay.cuny.edu/futureofnyc19/category/students/jason-azayev/), as this is a public facing website. Details will be worked
out in this repo first, and then edited onto the site. <br>


# Data and Explanation

<h6>Season</h6>	
Because influenza activity peaks in winter, the influenza season is named for the two calendar years over which a single influenza epidemic spans. CDC defines the influenza season as beginning with week 40 (generally the first week in October) of one calendar year and ending with week 20 of the following calendar year (generally the third week in May).<br>
	
<h6>Region	
The five regions in New York are defined by county as Capital District Region counties: Albany, Clinton, Columbia, Delaware, Essex, Franklin, Fulton, Greene, Hamilton, Montgomery, Otsego, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Warren, Washington Central Region counties: Broome, Cayuga, Chenango, Cortland, Herkimer, Jefferson, Lewis, Madison, Oneida, Onondaga, Oswego, St Lawrence, Tioga, Tompkins Metropolitan Region counties: Dutchess, Nassau, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Suffolk, Sullivan, Ulster, Westchester New York City counties/boroughs: Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens, Richmond Western Region counties: Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Chemung, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Ontario, Orleans, Schuyler, Seneca, Steuben, Wayne, Wyoming, Yates<br>
	
<h6>County	</h6>
Cases are assigned to a county based on this order of preference: 1) the patient’s address, 2) the ordering healthcare provider’s address, or 3) the ordering facility’s address.<br>

<h6>CDC Week	</h6>
CDC designates each week of the year with a sequential number starting with 1 to a maximum of 52 or 53. Week 1 is the first week of the year that has at least four days in the calendar year. CDC defines the influenza season as beginning with week 40 (generally the first week in October) and ending with week 20 of the following calendar year (generally the third week in May). Also known as MMWR week.<br>

<h6>Week Ending Date</h6>	
The last date of each CDC week. Each week begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday; week ending dates are always on a Saturday.<br>

<h6>Disease	</h6>
When the laboratory test can discern virus type (type A or type B), cases are counted by the corresponding disease (“Influenza A” or “Influenza B”). When the virus type cannot be differentiated, cases are counted as “Influenza Unspecified”.<br>

<h6>Count	</h6>
The number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases reported to NYSDOH for the corresponding season, week, disease, and county.<br>

<h6>County Centroid</h6>
